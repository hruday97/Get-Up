# Get-Up
This is an android application I made. The app lets you set multiple alarms. When adding an alarm for the first time the app will ask you for permission to read contacts and send messages. If you decline these permissions the app will work only as a simple alarm. But if you accept these permissions special features will be added to the basic alarm application. After accepting the permissions if you do not dismiss the alarm before it stops ringing the application will select a random contact from your phone's contact list and send a message to the selected random contact.
